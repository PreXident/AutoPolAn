Ok tak tohle se jeste zmeni

1. Download and install XAMPP from: http://www.apachefriends.org/
    (You need mysql checked during install)

2. Run XAMPP control and start Apache and MySQL

3. Run your favorite web browser (not IE for no fucking reason) and type address: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

4. Click at Import (top menu). Then click "Choose file" button and choose database/create.sql and click GO button.

5. That's it. At the left is new database called textan and it's ready to use. When you click on it, you should see +-10 tables.
   If there will be some sql scripts to fill the DB with some data, just repeat step 4 with that other script instead of create.sql
   
    

Another possibility:
1. Download MySql database from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
2. Install server and some client (commandline client, MySQL Workbench, or binding for your IDE)
3. Run database/create.sql, which create "textan" database
4. Change user, password and url in hibernate.cfg.xml (or data.properties) as you need.
    (Please don't push your changes in GitHub.)

(TODO: create user in MySql for Textan server.)
