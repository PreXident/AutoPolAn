Dears,
 sorry, that I didn't send a reminder, even so few of us sent me s report. It's nice! :)

Tam:
I am still fixing some bugs in my own code. Not much to report today.

Adam:
i have forgotten about sunday summary and there was no reminder ;-)
i have prepared basic interaction with the graph as proof of concept, but it is not yet pushed to github
i will correct that when i got home from work

Me:
I haven't much to report, too. I spent some time with a cleaning of the code in the repository  (new versions of frameworks etc.), especially in TextPro branch and master branch, so I hope that everything works. I also continue to interconnection between Web services and DAO. I think that it could be done in the evening.


Don't forget to send me another report on Wednesday!

Petr
