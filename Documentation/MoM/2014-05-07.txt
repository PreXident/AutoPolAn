All here!

Adam
- almost all HWKs from last time done

Tam
- proposal rejected by Ondrej

HWK
- Adam, it should be obvious which graph mode is selected
- Adam, use icon instead of words for graph mode buttons (rather tool bar)
- Adam, forward immediately after back should not forget user changes
- Adam, close buttons! You lazy, programmer!
- Adam, filter field should be cleared after selection (or maybe option in settings)
- Adam, optional HWK - add possibility to add anchor for unanchored relations by drag and drop
- Adam, back to objects forgets new objects
- Adam, add label to context menu displaying currently selected entity/object/relation...
- Adam, remove relation when object is null throws an exception
- Adam, tabs for quick go back to certain step (or at least for orientation)
- Peter, test relation without anchor
- create documentation placeholders in repository, go through previous MoMs and pick documentation notes from there

Do not forget a chapter "How to setup the system for new domain" in documentation!
Possible extension: think of a way to provide arguments (types, obligatoriness) to relations

Next meeting - see issue #35
