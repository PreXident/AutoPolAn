Hi,
 i'm sending summary as always.

Adam:
most of my homework from last meeting is done:
- adapted client for changed webservices
- down arrow now switches focus to list below
- only one list in selecting objects
- pipeline now supports going back (changes are lost though, even if you go immediatelly forward again)
- graph now contain buttons to switch modes
- and a little bugfix: it is no longer possible to create split entity/relation by clearing entity/relation

Vaclav:
nothing (It is the content of his email.)

Jakub:
I haven't done as much as I planned, but was studying how to ran binaries from java. I can run learning, but now I'm in state, when i can learn new model, but i can't get info about progress (but it's in separate thread ;) )
And was figuring out linking libraries ;)

Tam:
I have studied with machine learning to validate my prototype. I try some method on python, not java.

I am still waiting for Ondrej's reply. I would need him Ondrej on next meeting.

Me:
I'm a little ashamed that I didn't do anything on the project. I only try to run nametag, but the last commit from Jakub seems to work.

I sent an email about next meeting to Ondrej, so I let you know the result.
See you on Wednesday,
Petr
