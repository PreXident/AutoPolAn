Dears,
 again short summary...

Jakub:
I haven't done too much:
- waiting for new view for creating training data (but continue
working on it because I'm using my dummy implementation)
- re-implementing loading properties (not done yet) 

Tam:
I have devoted my time for implementing/testing new features of ML, It still have some strange errors, hopefully I intend to finish ML part this Thursday.

Adam:
quite some work has been done on my part, so the most important things:
- created run scripts for client
- default server is now the virtual one
- created simple dist task for client
- null objects are not passed as assigned to relations
- fixed some visualization problems reported by Peter
- added context menu for graphs
- better login prompting
- fixed hypergraph visualization problem
- proofreading of the brief manual

Me:
I wrote a brief manual for client in czech and while writing I tested Textan. I found lots of small bugs, mainly visual bugs, so I will report it sometimes. (Some of it Adam already fixed.) I know, it's not much, but administration is so time-consuming and boring...:/

Vaclav didn't send anything again. So Venca, do you want to continue in the project with us? Lots of features are waiting for a database background...

See you on Thursday at 13:00 in the lab,
Petr
