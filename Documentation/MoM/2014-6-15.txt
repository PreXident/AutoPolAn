Hi guys,
 so, firstly summary:

Adam:
- dialog for userlogin is shown after main window is displayed, so default icon is not visible
- if first connection to server fails, the object list window closes
- vertex colors are now determined by object id
- dialogs in main window made lightweight
- client removes carriage return from reports
- graph window now contains spinner for changing distance
- prevented some NPEs when adding object to relation, but this still needs to think it over
- you can use context menus on various places to display graphs
- pagination and filtering on object list window is ready

Jakub:
-started with auto-generating training data from database
-go through reworked code, repaired error handling and work in your comments (mainly reworked learning parameters handling)

Tam:
Last week, I worked on changing the return value of DoubleRanking from Map to Pair ArrayList and adding another feature (the mutual relation object) of ML (unfinished)

Me:
I mainly did revision of nametag integration code, tested textan on linux and fixed some bug with encoding in DB. I know nothing special, but now Jakub and I know new crazy things about Java and Windows...


Further something about the next meeting:
I finally got the answer from Ondrej, it will be nice to have the next meeting with him. Unfortunately, he can't come to our meeting on Thursday. Possible dates are:

- on Tuesday 14-16
- on Wdnesday afternoon (say 15-18)
- on Friday at any time 9-16?

I vote for Wednesday, but I can any time, and you? It might be better to create some issue in github.

And finally the last thing... 
We probably will get some virtual machine from school, where we can run TextAn server and maybe DB, so it will be good to prepare final set of object/relation types based on information from Honza Horinek.

Please watch issues on gihub, or send me email about next meeting (see above),
Petr
