Dears,
 so, here we go.

Jakub:
I try unite nametag entities with database (where i found bug with encoding...issue reported and fixed in my branch).
Then I get some problem with nametag, because it uses strings as IDs and working hierarchically (characters with higher indexes refining previous), so now I'm using dictionary.
Now I'm trying debug nametag integration, because I found a bug (different indexes in textan and nametag).
I was playing with learning part too, I made a config file with parameters for learning new models and integrate it in my part.

Adam:
i am sorry, but i am too tired to try to write this summary, so i just send commit messages:

- Graph modes buttons are now toggable, embedded in toolbar and have (placeholder) icons instead of text.
- Added tooltips to graph mode buttons.
- When going back to editing objects new objects should no longer be forgotten
- Unanchored relations now have their RelationOccurrence with null Anchor when document is sent to server to be saved
- Continue immediately after back no longer discards user changes. Also a few preparations for handling document collisions
- Added option to clear filter fields after selection
- Unanchored relations now have their RelationOccurrence and its Anchor with null alias and -1 position when document is sent to server to be saved
- InnerWindows and OuterStages now have minimal size
- OuterStages now have proper icon too
- Minor layout changes in object list for graph
- New objects now loses aliases even if they are replaced as candidates by db objects
- Relation list view now shows relation alias too
- When assigning objects to relations, objects have their type displayed
- When selecting object the current selection is displayed (not as a label but as selected record in list)
- Fixed object type name for new objects in Relation Step
- Buttons in Relation Step are now all at the bottom
- Added/enhanced tooltips to Entity and Relation step

i know i am lazy, but i do not think i could express it better anyway

Tam:
I am programming the preparation for feature selection in Machine Learning. It include:

+ Levenshtein distance for two words to compare the similarity between Object alias and entity text
+ Levenshtein distance for two array to compare the similarity between two long strings from two different docs
+ Matching object type and entity type (1 for match, 0 for non-match)
+ Neighbor computing (not finished yet)

If you want me to do anything, pls do not hesitate to tell me. I often forgot what I intend to do at the first place.

Vaclav:
 - Encoding should be ok now
 - Working on logging & object concurrency

Me:
I researched Interceptors in CXF and in Hibernate, because I think it can be use to log changes in a database, and I done some changes in web service API.
I also reorganized directories in repository. I added Documentation directory, moved all documentation related things in the directory and added placeholders for a user documentation and a developmnet documentation, which are in requirements for the sw project.

And the last thing, what do we do with the next meeting? The best time for you (us) is Thursday after 15:40, but Jakub probably can't come. So, we could meet at this time, or is it problem for someone?

Regards,
Petr
