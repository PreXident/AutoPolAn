All here!
- Gradle server project is set up
- Spring could be used as CXF probably uses it anyway
- Kuba: create JavaML testing project

- NER will be available before the project start
	- someone to program cpp domain specific features for NER
- everyone is a tester of others - self organized project
- current state of project:
	- Venca (database):
		- hibernate - probably can be used
		- only server accesses the database
		- kind of messages between client and webserver
		- sql scripts
	- Tam (NER):
		- additions to NER
		- cpp to java connection - if not provided by Milan Straka
		- documents from client to server and other way
	- Kuba (machine learning):
		- JavaML could be used (both ranking and classification)
		- weka alternative, but more for teaching purposes, good algorithms must be found
		- special layer of abstraction to be able to switch to different library later
		- create JavaML testing project
	- Adam (client):
		- other java html editors
		- explore cxf
		- connect to server and test connectivity
	- Peter (machine learning, webserver, webservices):
		- explore spring, java cxf
		- all machine learning on server
		- probably ranking will be used as it fits our problem
		- hello world server

Next meeting on Tuesday at 15:40
Next meeting with Ondrej in two weeks or when NER ready or committee response
