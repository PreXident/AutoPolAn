Next meeting on Monday at 16:30.

- Decisions
  - why pipeline? maybe also mockups here
  - why (semi)automatic processing?
  - why state on client?

Documentation notes from Ondrej:

Chapters and sections should have capitalized all words (with exceptions ;-)
Requirements should explain main window mockup and that more things can be done simuntaneously.
Adopted solutions (Third party tools) should contain reasons too
Peter Sipos should be xplicitly marked as not member
Object assigner and nametag should have their own chapter (Core components)
All appendixes and images need references in text.

Overall Architecture
  - architecture overview
  - Communication
Server
  - server architecture
  - simple componenents?
  - name entity recognizer
  - object assigner
  ...
  - database
Client
- client architecture
- model
- controller and view

Sources -> Content of the dvd
github and test server links into introduction
explicitly meantion that only one language is supported at once
possible extension - support more languages at once

Lessons Learned into Developer notes, switch Developer notes and Future extensions

Ask KSWI secretary Košnářová
- if we can defend even
- if the documentation needs special binding or duplex
