Dears,
 short summary as usual...

Venca:
I tried to find what I dont have to do because its in optional requirements :D
Im looking how to set log4j logging only sql queries. (before spring it logged only sql. Now there is some garbage)

(Venca will write the development documentation, so this kind of a report is ok. :))

Adam:
i did not have much time, but managed to changed displaying colors so they are no longer hardcoded in css files but generated from ids
there is no user customization yet, however

ps: i will bring my netbook but i am not sure it would handle the whole system

Jakub:
I returned from France on saturday and reached PC hour ago, so i didn't have much tu report.
I will integrate my code (nametag integration) to master by Wednesday, i hope.
Now I´m looking for integration learning part (running executable binary from java).

Tam:
 - Tam sent me a long report in pdf (attachment). I hope it isn't due to misunderstanding. :)

Me:
 I added service layer in Server side. This layer is between web services and rest of server. At this time, there is a service, which provide access to db, a graph service (not implemented yet, because Venca's Graph factory has some bugs), a named entity recognizer service, which will use nametag one day, and object assignment service. 
 I also added the sql script, which fill the database with some sample data.
 (I also made ​​a few minor changes, for example change all identifiers to long type.)
Now I want to clean some unfinished tasks in server...

See you on Wednesday,
Petr

PS: Please write to me who can take the notebook.
