Dears,
 here is another short broadcast of our reports. Short, because I got reports only from Adam and Tam. So, next time I will send some notification again. 

Adam:

hi,
i have been adapting the client to the new webservices and i have encountered several problems:
Relation
- where are orders?
- why it contains only one object id?

ObjectType's name is typed to int

Document procesor
- getEditingTicket wants two tickets, why?
    - i understand the Ticket, so it can get the username, but why there is parameter EditingTicket, which it should return?
- getObjectsFromString
    - the first argument is string, but getEntitiesFromString takes some kind of wrapper around string as the first parameter
    - there are no ratings of the candidates
- getObjectTypes returns java.lang.Object

i have successfully connected to DataProvider (NullPointerException caused crash, but it is expected as server returns always null ;-) however if i try to connect to DocumentProcessor, this beaty is thrown:
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceException: classcz.cuni.mff.ufal.textan.commons.models.GetObjectsFromStringResponse do not have a property of the name assignment
Caused by: javax.xml.bind.JAXBException: assignment is not a valid property on classcz.cuni.mff.ufal.textan.commons.models.GetObjectsFromStringResponse
i briefly looked into generated sources and i can see assignment property there, but it  has only a getter and no setter

so i keep changes only locally until these problems are solved, ok?

Tam:

I committed and pushed the interface of ranking into github. However, it 
takes input as the directory of files, so I will try to finish the 
functions which takes a list of entity or a string as input (choices for 
you guys) by next Wednesday.

Me:

I changed connection to db from ugly static class to spring beans and tests so that they use spring as well. Further, I added another instructions how to set up MySql without Apache and MySqlAdmin. (And I added some mess, too :D)

Yesterday I fixed some problems from Adam's report. I tried to fix the strange wrappers the last week, but I wasn't successful, so it and exceptions remain without fix.

I know that Vaškova laziness is my fault, so I hope I will give him better instructions than now on Wednesday. :/

See you on Wednesday,
Petr
