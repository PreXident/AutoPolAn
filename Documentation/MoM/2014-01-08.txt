All here, including Ondrej Bojar and Honza Horinek.

Project overview (what we have done so far).
Beta NER is ready, but no documentation so far.
- Monday and Tuesday could be meeting

HWK:
- for every webservice there should be a test client that shows webservice's features - JUnit tests?
- give a proper name to "object matcher"
- document author priority in machine learning as a feature
- user documentation must contain guide about inserting incomplete information
End of January tasks:
- integrate NER and tagger
- viewing db records from GUI (prototype, even textual with list of nodes and edges)
- db setup for dummies!

Next meeting with Milan Straka probably on Tuesday 9:00.

PS: dialog + '-' -> display error!
