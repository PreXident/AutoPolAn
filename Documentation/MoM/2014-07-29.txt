HWK:
- Adam, linux has issues with first run - main window cannot be resized and main menus are not displayed correctly
- Adam, remove 1/0 from pagination everyewhere

- Adam, look at Texmaker for tex editing
- Adam, add toolbar to the main window
- Adam, include all objects check box in Report Object Step should be unchecked by default!
- Adam, document list does not display processTime correctly - copy&paste error with filling the column
- Adam, change the behaviour when the report is changed, so when it is saved, the old id and new text is sent so the new text is replaced
- Adam, add warning that changes will erase progress (probably some king of visualization on slider with tooltip)
- Peter & Venca, joining objects does not work, why? Foreign key issue?
- Peter, send first pages to your graphic friend
- Peter, clean server database
- Peter, add method to webservices to save report with id and text to replace newly changed text
- Peter, create architecture documentation from our code
- Venca, when object is in relation with itself, the graph (both relational and objective) does not contain the relation
- Venca, lock the whole db for write when document is added
- Venca, add global version to DOA
- Venca, solve issue #68
- Kuba, temp files should be created in temp directory and should be deleted when not needed anymore
