Hi guys,
 ...another bit boring summary :) : 

Jakub:
I reworked model loading and learning (when server starts, it looks for nametag model and if find some, than use it, else start training new one).
Also I included morpohodita and text tagging (but I'm not sure if I didn't mention it later ;) )

Adam:

as expected there was not enough time during our company teambuilding to do some serious work on the project
so except for some incomplete fixing of text rendering, i have not much to report

i hope i will be more productive now as examination term is over for me

Tam:

I am writing the test for machine learning. Nothing special, getting familiar with jUnit test.

Me:
I mainly tested different parts of Textan. The good news is that master branch works on linux. But there is still a lot of things that needs to "fine-tune" (e.g. https://github.com/PreXident/TextAn/issues/46).

I also got a documentation of Petr Skoda's software project, so I add it to drive for inspiration (http://goo.gl/wU0XO0), and I sent an email to Ondrej about the next meeting, but he hasn't answered yet.


See you on Thursday in the Lab,
Petr
