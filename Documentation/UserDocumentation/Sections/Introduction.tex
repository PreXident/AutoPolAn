% Section: Introduction


This section is intended to provide introduction to the project and glossary of
terms used in the rest of the documentation and the application itself.

\subsection{System overview}

With an increasing amount of electronically distributed unstructured text
(newspapers, letters etc.) there is a growing demand for its analysis and
understanding by computer means. This process should be as automated as possible
due to the time consumption and huge data amount.

\textan{} (Text Analyser) serves this purpose. In other words, \textan{} is a
tool that processes structured data buried in plain text documents and provides
basic operations to manipulate the extracted data. The extraction consists of
recognizing significant phrases, matching them with data already stored in the
database and discovering dependencies expressed in the text. The first two tasks
are semi-automatic in \textan{}, whereas the last one is manual only. The
objective of \textan{} is to provide a robust tool which supports the procedure.
Although first impulse came from the Police needs, \textan{} is made as general as
possible to allow easy configuration for any other domain as needed.

Users of \textan{} can manage the stored documents. The unprocessed documents can
be inserted into the system for later use. Full text search supports both
unprocessed and processed documents and more sophisticated search methods can be
performed on annotated reports. Users can annotate unprocessed documents stored in
the database or completely new reports either imported from local files or written
from scratch.

This documentation describes \textan{} from the user and administrator
perspective.
