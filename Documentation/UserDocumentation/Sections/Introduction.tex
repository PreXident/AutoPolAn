% Section: Introduction

With an increasing amount of electronically distributed unstructured text
(newspapers, letters etc.) there is a growing demand for its analysis and
understanding by computer means. This process should be as automated as possible
due to the time consumption and huge data amount.

\textan{} (Text Analyser) serves this purpose. In other words, \textan{} is a
tool that helps to extract structured data from plain text documents and provides
basic operations to manipulate them. The extraction consists of
recognizing significant phrases, matching them with structured data already stored in the
database and discovering dependencies expressed in the text.
The
objective of \textan{} is to provide a robust tool which supports the procedure.
The first two tasks
are semi-automatic in \textan{}, whereas the last one is currently manual only. 
Although first impulse came from the needs of a department of the Czech Police
and \textan{} so far processed only police reports, \textan{} is made as general as
possible to allow an easy configuration for any other domain as needed.

\section{System overview}
The system consists of two main components -- the client application
and the server. For information intended for end-users about client usage, see
Section \ref{sec:ClientUsage}. Instructions intended for system
administrators can be found in Chapter \ref{sec:AdminGuide}, mainly in Section
\ref{sec:Client} about configuring the client and in Section \ref{sec:Server}
about server configuration.

From another perspective, \textan{} can be seen as a tool for managing a
knowledge base where the knowledge arrives in plain text documents.
At the beginning and also at any later point, unprocessed documents
can be inserted into the system. Full text search operates on both
unprocessed and processed documents and more sophisticated search methods can be
performed on annotated documents. Users can annotate unprocessed documents
already stored
in the database or add and annotate new documents by importing them from local files or
writing them from scratch. See Figure \ref{fig:Overview} for a simplified document
lifecycle diagram.

This documentation describes \textan{} from the user and administrator
perspective. Refer to the separate Developer Documentation for technical
details.
