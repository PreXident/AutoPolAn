% Section: Introduction

% FOR ENTERTAIN: The spider opens his heavy eyes. He stand up, look through the lousy windows. The sun is flaring, kissing all over the earth. He said to himself: ``It's time''. Students are rushing out of the dormitory like rats desert from a sinking ship. Some are going to the public transport, waiting for the regular hooves from the distance. The bus comes and goes, its double tires sing high notes on the road. Some are visiting the car park. The wheels of the cars creaked around, then they crawled into the city centre. A man and girl are crossing street, with their arms around each other's waists. Then the man must have said something supposed to be funny because two of them are laughing like hyenas. The spider retreats from the windows. The daily screen makes him so lonesome and depressed. Another day has just begun.

%TODO what is textan

%TextAn (Text Analyser) is the product of our software project groups (consists of 5 members) at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague (MFF UK). The tool is attributed to Software Project subject, developed in 9 months from Jan 2014 to Sep 2014, and supervised by RNDr. OndÅ™ej Bojar, PhD. It is a client-server tool which support mining structured information from text documents. At the moment, the documents are specified to police report but TextAn could be applied to a wide range of domains.

\comment[Jakub]{Adam}{Ondrej had a lot of comments on introduction, but if you
are about to change it completely, I will not bother to translate them, unless
you explicitly ask for them.}

With an increasing amount of electronically distributed unstructured text (newspapers, letters etc.) there is growing demand for its analyzing and understanding computer. This process should be automated due to the time consumption and huge data amount.

\textan{} (Text Analyser) serves such purpose, targeting the Police reports. 
In other words, \textan{} is a tool which supports mining structured data buried in the Police reports. The term ``structured data'' consists of two concepts. 
First, it contains name, street, date of birth, crime and other named entities related to some people. 
Second, the data contain the relations between two entities. 
For example, the relation between a person and their date of birth, the relation between two persons. The objective of \textan{} is to provide a robust tool which supports the procedure, either automatically and manually.
Although first impulse came from the Police needs, \textan{} is made as general
as possible to allow easy configuration for any other domain as needed.

\textan{} has client-server structure. It supports following operations:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bring new solution to the classic problem of extracting data from text.
  \item Provide the service for both automatic detection and manual adjustment.
  \item Make the adjustment of data as simple as possible for users.
  \item Make the graphic user interface as fruitful as possible.
  \end{itemize}

This documentation describes \textan{} from the perspective of an user. 
All the concepts are explained in the \emph{Glossary}.
