% Section: Introduction


This section is intended to provide introduction to the project and glossary of
terms used in the rest of the documentation and the application itself.

\subsection{System overview}

With an increasing amount of electronically distributed unstructured text (newspapers,
letters etc.) there is growing demand for its analyzing and understanding computer.
This process should be automated due to the time consumption and huge data amount.

\comment{Petr}{Remove mentions of police.}

\textan{} (Text Analyser) serves such purpose, targeting the Police reports. 
In other words, \textan{} is a tool which supports mining structured data buried
in the Police reports. The term ``structured data'' consists of two concepts. 
First, it contains name, street, date of birth, crime and other named entities related to some people. 
Second, the data contain the relations between two entities. 
For example, the relation between a person and their date of birth, the relation between two persons. The objective of \textan{} is to provide a robust tool which supports the procedure, either automatically and manually.
Although first impulse came from the Police needs, \textan{} is made as general
as possible to allow easy configuration for any other domain as needed.

\textan{} has client-server structure. It supports following operations: \comment{Petr}{Operations!?}
  
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bring new solution to the classic problem of extracting data from text.
  \item Provide the service for both automatic detection and manual adjustment.
  \item Make the adjustment of data as simple as possible for users.
  \item Make the graphic user interface as fruitful as possible.
\end{itemize}

This documentation describes \textan{} from the perspective of an user. 
All the concepts are explained in the \emph{Glossary}. \comment{Petr}{useless}
