% Section: Introduction

With an increasing amount of electronically distributed unstructured text
(newspapers, letters etc.) there is a growing demand for its analysis and
understanding by computer means. This process should be as automated as possible
due to the time consumption and huge data amount.

\textan{} (Text Analyser) serves this purpose. In other words, \textan{} is a
tool that processes structured data buried in plain text documents and provides
basic operations to manipulate the extracted data. The extraction consists of
recognizing significant phrases, matching them with data already stored in the
database and discovering dependencies expressed in the text. The first two tasks
are semi-automatic in \textan{}, whereas the last one is manual only. The
objective of \textan{} is to provide a robust tool which supports the procedure.
Although first impulse came from the Police needs, \textan{} is made as general as
possible to allow easy configuration for any other domain as needed.

\section{System overview}
The system consists of two main components -- the client application
and the server. For information intended for end-users about client usage, see
Section \ref{sec:ClientUsage}. Instruction intended for system
administrators can be found in Chapter \ref{sec:AdminGuide}, mainly in Section
\ref{sec:Client} about configuring the client and in Section \ref{sec:Server}
about server configuration.

Users of \textan{} can manage the stored documents. The unprocessed documents
can be inserted into the system for later use. Full text search supports both
unprocessed and processed documents and more sophisticated search methods can be
performed on annotated reports. Users can annotate unprocessed documents stored
in the database or completely new reports either imported from local files or
written from scratch. See Figure \ref{fig:Overview} for simplified document
lifecycle diagram.

This documentation describes \textan{} from the user and administrator
perspective.
