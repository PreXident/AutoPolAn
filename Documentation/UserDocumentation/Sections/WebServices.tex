% Section: Web Services

As a method of communication in a client-server model are used XML-based web services
(or W3C web services). It means, that the server expose web API described in WSDL.
This makes very easy to develop different clients that can communicate with
\textan{} server.

These WSDL files are available either in source codes, or on URL \emph{http://hostname:port/soap},
where hostname indicates a computer with \textan{} server instance running on the port.

For more information about communication pattern see 
\comment{Petr}{reference to the Developers Doc.}
