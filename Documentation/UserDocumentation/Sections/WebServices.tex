% Section: Web Services
XML-based web services (or W3C web services) are a method of communication in
the client-server model. It means, that the server exposes web API described in
WSDL. This makes developing different clients that can communicate with
\textan{} server very easy.

These WSDL files are available either in source codes, or on URL \emph{http://hostname:port/soap},
where hostname indicates a computer with \textan{} server instance running on the port.

For more information about communication pattern see Section
\ref{DEV-sec:Communication} in the developer documentation.
