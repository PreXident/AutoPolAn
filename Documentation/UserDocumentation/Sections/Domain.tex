% Section: Domain and convention

Because \textan{} is very universal, it is necessary to use right configuration.
\textan{} system can be a really powerful tool, but it must be configured properly
for your domain to achieve the best results. Also it is important to establish
some convention that describes usage of the configuration.

The domain is represented by object types and relation types, eventually by roles
of relation types. \comment[Petr]{Petr}{Example: types for police reports vs types for movie descriptions}

If you define too big set of types, it can be difficult for users to understand
their usage. Otherwise, if you define too small set of types, their meaning will
be vague which could confuse users. It is very difficult to select suitable set
of types.

In addition, every user has his own opinion when to use certain type. In this
situation, it can be useful to define the convention. The convention should contain
explanation how to use each concrete type and examples of usage.
