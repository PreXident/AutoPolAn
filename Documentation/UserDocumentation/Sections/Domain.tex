% Section: Domain and convention

Because \textan{} is very universal, it is necessary to use the right
configuration. \textan can be a really powerful tool, but it must be
configured properly for your domain to achieve the best results. Also it is
important to establish some convention that describes the usage of the
configuration.

The domain is represented by object types and relation types, alternatively by
roles of relation types. For example in some domains is necessary to have types
like ``state'', ``city'', ``street'' and other domains merge these types in to
``address'' or simply ``place''.

If you define too large set of types, it can be difficult for users to understand
their usage. Otherwise, if you define too small set of types, their meaning will
be vague which could confuse users. It is very difficult to select suitable set
of types.

In addition, every user has his own opinion when to use certain types. In this
situation, it can be useful to define the convention. The convention should
contain explanation how to use each concrete type and examples of usage.
