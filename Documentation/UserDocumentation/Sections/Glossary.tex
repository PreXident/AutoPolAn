Some terms are used in a very specific manner in the documentation and in both
the client and the server, therefore it is really essential to understand their
meaning. Otherwise, it is possible to misunderstand the rest of the text.

\begin{description}
\item[Document]
The document is an arbitrary text that is processed by \textan{}. E.g. a police
report, a letter, a movie review or a judgment. In the following text, the terms
``document'' and ``report'' are used interchangeably.

\item[Object]
The term ``object'' refers to our representation of some unique thing in
\textan{}. Consider for example a person with name Joseph Smith from Prague with
personal identifier 000123/4567. The object refers to this person in the real
world, in meat and bones.

\item[Alias]
An alias represents a designation of a object. For example: Joseph Smith, Joe
Smith, Joey S., J. Smith or just Smith can be names of one specific person.
Names are aliases for the person.

\item[Entity]
An entity is a sequence of words recognized either by the named entity
recognizer or by a user. The entity will be later assigned to an object.
Consider for example this sentence: ``Joe Smith was seen in Prague on 5th
September.'' The sentence contains 3 entities: Joe Smith (person), Prague
(city), 5th September (date). We do not know which objects belong to these
entities until the text is fully processed. Prague can represent the capital
city of the Czech Republic, or a city in the USA.

\item[Object/Entity Type]
Each entity and each object must have a type. For example, person, date, city,
country etc. The set of types in the system depends on the domain which the
system is deployed to. Consider for example sentence: ``Adam and Eve live in
Paradise.'' There are three entities, two (Adam, Eve) of the type ``person'' and
one (Paradise) of the type ``address''.

\item[Object Assignment]
The ``Object assignment'' or just ``assignment' is a process at which an object
is assigned to a recognized entity.  After the assignment, the text that
represents the entity in a document becomes the alias of the assigned object.
The entity and the assigned object must have the same type, this is an essential
aspect of the assignment. For example, there is a document in which an entity of
the type ``date'' with the text ``14th March 2011'' was found and there is an
object in the database of the type ``date'' representing the day with aliases
``the Fourteenth of March, 2011'', ``14/3/2011'' and ``14/3/11''. The object
will be probably assigned to the entity, because we know that they represent the
same thing. After the assignment, the object will also have the alias ``14th
March 2011''.

\item[Object Merging/Joining]
Because objects are created only based on information from documents, there may
be a situation when two objects represent the same thing and this identity was
revealed only later. The operation ``merge/join object'' is used to solve this
issue, it merges two objects into a new one and the original objects are
replaced with the new object. The new object has aliases of both original
objects. The reverse operation is called ``split objects''.

\item[Relation]
The relation represents any relationship between objects mentioned in a
document. The relation can be represented in the document by an anchor word or
phrase, or it can be unexpressed, which means without any anchor in the
document. See Anchor below.
Consider this example: ``Adam (890524/1367) is married to Eve''. Three objects
appear in the sentence - persons Adam and Eve and the id 890524/1367. There
are two relations: Adam ``has'' 890524/1367 without an anchor and Adam
``marriage'' Eve with the anchor ``married''.

\item[Relation Type]
Each relation has a type. For example born, reside, die, kill etc. Similarly to
object/relation types the set of relation types in the system depends on the
domain which the system is deployed to. Consider for example sentence: ``Cain
shot Abel.'' There is one relation (with anchor ``shot'') of the type
``murder''.

\item[Anchor]
The anchor is a word or a sequence of words that is bound to a relation between
objects. Consider for example the sentence: Joey Smith killed Mary-Ann S. There
is a relation between Joey Smith and Mary-Ann S., which is represented by the
word ``killed''. The word is the anchor.
\comment{Ondrej}{Why do you not write about type here?}
\comment{Petr}{The example should show what is an anchor. The type isn't important in this situation.}

\item[Roles and orders]
Each object in a relation can have a role assigned. This role is mostly used
for visualization and for storing of additional information. Moreover object can
also have an order or index assigned which is just an integral number used for
graph visualization\ifdefined\USRDOC{} (see Section \ref{sssec:EditRelations})
\fi{}\ifdefined\DEVDOC{} (see Section \ref{USR-sssec:EditRelations} in the user
documentation)\fi{}. For example relation created from sentence ``Bill killed
Joe.'' could be represented like this: Bill (-1, murderer) --kill--> (1, victim)
Joe.
