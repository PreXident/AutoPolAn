Terms are used in very specific manner in the documentation and in both the
client and the server, therefore it is really essential to understand their
meaning. Otherwise, it is possible to misunderstand the rest of the text.

\begin{description}
\item[Object]
The term "object" refers to our representation of some unique thing in
\textan{}. Consider for example a person with name Joseph Smith from Prague with
identifier 000123/4567. The object refers to this person in the real world, in
meat and bones.

\item[Alias]
The alias represents a designation of a object. For example: Joseph Smith, Joe
Smith, Joey S., J. Smith or just Smith can be names of one concrete person.
Names are aliases for the person.

%\item[Alias occurrence]

\item[Document]
The document is an arbitrary text that is processed by \textan{}. E.g. a police
report, a letter, a movie review or a judgment. In the following text the terms
document and report are used interchangeably.

\item[Entity]
An entity is a sequence of words recognized either by a named entity recognizer
or by a user. The entity will be later assigned to an object and it becomes an alias
of the object. Consider for example the sentence: Joe Smith was seen
in Prague on 5th September. The sentence contains 3 entities: Joe Smith (person),
Prague (city), 5th September (date). We don't know which objects belong to these
entities yet. Prague can represent the capital city of the Czech Republic,
or a city in the USA.

\item[Object/Entity Type]
Each object and each entity has a type. For example person, date, city, country
etc. The set of types in the system depends on the domain which the system is
deployed to. There are some universal predefined ones, but the system
administrator needs to prepare a customized list to fully unleash the power of
the project.

\item[Relation]
The relation represents any relationship between objects mentioned in a document.
A relation can be represented in a document by an anchor word, or it can be
unexpressed, which means without any anchor in a document. See Anchor below.
\comment[anyone]{Adam}{Check this sentence with two relations, one with anchor, one without anchor.}
Consider this example: "Adam (890524/1367) is married to Eve". Three objects
appear in the sentence - persons Adam and Eve and the id 890524/1367. There
are two relations: Adam "has" 890524/1367 without an anchor and Adam "marriage"
Eve with the anchor "married".

\item[Relation Type]
Each relation has a type. For example born, reside, die, kill etc. Similarly to
object/relation types the set of relation types in the system depends on the
domain which the system is deployed to. There are some universal predefined ones, but the system administrator needs to prepare customized list to fully unleash the power of the project.

\item[Anchor]
An anchor is a word or a sequence of words that is bound to a relation between
objects. Consider for example the sentence: Joey Smith killed Mary-Ann S. There
is a relation between Joey Smith and Mary-Ann S., which is represented by the
word "killed". The word is the anchor. \comment{Ondrej}{Why do you not write
about type here?}

\item[Roles and orders]
Each object in a relation can have a role assigned. This role is mostly used
for visualisation and storing additional information. Moreover object can also
have order assigned which is just an integral number used for graph
visualization\ifdefined\USRDOC{} (see Section \ref{sssec:EditRelations})\fi{}
\ifdefined\DEVDOC{} (see Section \ref{USR-sssec:EditRelations} in the user
documentation)\fi{}. For example relation created from sentence
"Bill killed Joe." could be represented like this:
Bill (-1, murderer) --kill--> (1, victim) Joe.

\comment{Petr}{is it necessary to explain terms: assignment, object merging, alias occurence?}
\comment{Adam}{Let's wait for Ondrej's feedback}
\comment[Petr]{Ondrej}{Yes, to be sure}
