\section{Introduction}

% FOR ENTERTAIN: The spider opens his heavy eyes. He stand up, look through the lousy windows. The sun is flaring, kissing all over the earth. He said to himself: ``It's time''. Students are rushing out of the dormitory like rats desert from a sinking ship. Some are going to the public transport, waiting for the regular hooves from the distance. The bus comes and goes, its double tires sing high notes on the road. Some are visiting the car park. The wheels of the cars creaked around, then they crawled into the city centre. A man and girl are crossing street, with their arms around each other's waists. Then the man must have said something supposed to be funny because two of them are laughing like hyenas. The spider retreats from the windows. The daily screen makes him so lonesome and depressed. Another day has just begun.


TODO what is textan

TextAn (Text Analyser) is the product of our software project groups (consists of 5 members) at Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague (MFF UK). The tool is attributed to Software Project subject, developed in 9 months from Jan 2014 to Sep 2014, and supervised by RNDr. Ondřej Bojar, PhD. It is a client-server tool which support mining structured information from text documents. At the moment, the documents are specified to police report but TextAn could be applied to a wide range of domains.

\section{Server}

\subsection{Installation guide}


This section will show you how to install and build \textan\ server. 
%An installation guide for a server side application of \textan.

\subsubsection{Prerequisites}
\label{sssec:SerInstPre}

The \textan\ server requires installation of \emph{Java 8 JRE
\footnote{We recommend to use JRE from \emph{Oracle}, available at: \url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html}}}
or a later version and a relational database system (e.g. \emph{MySQL}).
The server should be platform independent, so it runs on any system where JRE is available,
but it depends on native and 3rd party libraries. 
Supported operating systems in the distribution of the \textan\ server are
Linux (32 bit and 64 bit) and Windows (32 bit and 64 bit). % I am thinking ...

\subsubsection{Installation}

The \textan\ server distribution archive contains all files needed for \textan\ server to operate,
such as server binaries, native libraries, run scripts and additional resources.
For installation it is sufficient to unpack its content into any directory.

\subsubsection{Basic configuration}

Before the first start, it is necessary to set up the server and the database.

TODO write how to setup server

TODO add some link to \ref{sec:ServerSettings}

\subsubsection{Starting the server}

The server can be started by starting scripts in its root directory. 
Scripts for different operating systems unfortunately do not provide the same functionality.

The start script for the Linux-based operating system (\emph{run.sh}) runs the server application as daemon
and can be used to run the server as system service.

The start script for the Microsoft Windows OS is less powerful, only runs the server application. 
To run the server as a background process, the Windows Service is required. 
Unfortunately, there are no components shipped with the Jetty Distribution to make it a formal Windows Service.
However, we recommend the use of \emph{Apache ProcRun's Daemon
\footnote{More information can be found on \url{https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/procrun.html} and in JavaDoc documentation for \emph{cz.cuni.mff.ufal.textan.server.AppEntry} class.}}.

\subsection{Settings}
\label{sec:ServerSettings}

\subsubsection{Web server settings}

%connector
\paragraph{server.connector.host} The particular interface to listen on. If not set or 0.0.0.0, the web server listens on port on all interfaces.

\paragraph{server.connector.port} The port to listen on. If not set, the web server listens on port 9500.

%thread pool
\paragraph{server.threadPool.maxThreads} The maximum number of threads in web server thread pool. It determines a maximum number of simultaneously opened connections. The default value is 200.

\paragraph{server.threadPool.minThreads} The minimum number of threads in web server thread pool. The default value is 8.

\paragraph{server.threadPool.idleTimeout} The time in milliseconds that the connection can be idle before it is closed.

\subsubsection{Database connection settings}

%jdbc
\paragraph{jdbc.driverClassName} 

\paragraph{jdbc.url} 

\paragraph{jdbc.user}

\subsection{Data formats}

\section{Client}

This section contains all information needed to successfully install, configure and run \textan\ client side application.
However thanks to \textan\ client-server architecture and extensive use of webservices,
it is easy to prepare own implementation in any programmer language desired or even use general solutions as SoapUI
\footnote{More information can be found at \url{http://www.soapui.org/}},
if \textan\ default client does not provide all required features, user experience or integration to legacy system is needed.

\subsection{Installation guide}

This section describes how to install and configure \textan\ client on workstations of end users.

\subsubsection{Prerequisites}

The \textan\ client has the same requirement for \emph{Java 8 JRE} or later as the server (see \ref{sssec:SerInstPre}).
However, unlike the server side, it is pure Java application so there are no other additional limitations for operating system etc.
Any platform where JRE 8 is available can support the client.

\subsubsection{Installation}

Unpack an archive with the \textan\ client distribution into any directory. 
The archive contains a .jar file and starting scripts for the \emph{Microsoft Windows} and Linux-based operating systems
\footnote{run.bat for MS Windows and run.sh for Linux clones.\label{runscript_note}}.

\subsubsection{Basic configuration}

If the client is not supposed to connect to the default server, it is necessary to configure a server location. 
The client settings are by default stored in \emph{TextAn.properties\footnote{A description of format of .properties file can be found at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties}}}
in the client directory. 
Simply edit or add following lines to properties file (create it if it does not exist),
replacing default server address with the actual one:
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language=properties]
#url of the document processor
url.document=http://localhost:9500/soap/document
#url of the document processor wsdl
url.document.wsdl=http://localhost:9500/soap/document?wsdl
#url of the data provider
url.data=http://localhost:9500/soap/data
#url of the data provider
url.data.wsdl=http://localhost:9500/soap/data?wsdl
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Starting the client}

The .jar file from the distribution archive is executable,
but we recommend to use starting scripts\footref{runscript_note}.
Please consult documentation of your Java Platform provider,
if running scripts are not available for your system.
For description of command line arguments see \ref{ssec:CliCmdArg}

\subsubsection{Uninstallation}

The client application does not use any files or resources outside its install directory,
unless explicitly told to do otherwise.
To uninstall the client just delete its installation folder
and all files explicitly used as configuration storage.

\subsection{Settings}

This section describes all settings affecting the client behaviour.
The two basic means are command line arguments and configuration file in properties format.

\subsubsection{Command line arguments}
\label{ssec:CliCmdArg}

The client has one command line option (-h, --help, /H, /?) which displays the usage information.
Apart from that it takes only one command line argument which is the location of settings file.
If no file is specified, default property file \emph{TextAn.properties} will be used.
If '-' is provided, the standard input will be read and settings will not be stored.

\subsubsection{TextAn.properties}

This section contains a list of properties from configuration file that controls client behaviour.

%TODO: add all the properties and their description, can point to ssec:Settings
