The architecture of \textan\ is based on client-server model. Two main components
are the \textan\ server and \textan\ client which communicate via W3C web services
(SOAP protokol).

\subsection{Server architecture}

The server architecture is based on a logical multilayered architecture. It
consists of 5 layers: a presentation layer, a service layer, a business logic layer, 
a persistence layer and a data layer.

\textan\ Client is a JavaFX application which naturaly forces Model-View-Controller
pattern.

Model classes can be found in package cz.cuni.mff.ufal.textan.core. It contains
mainly client side representation of object, entity, relation etc. This way
clients do not have to use directly websevice representation, so when it is
altered, changes needed in client side are localized into this package. Moreover
there is Client class which completely hides the webservices and transformation
webservice data representation to client side representation.

Subpackages of the Core package focus on individual client side tasks, like
displaying graphs and processing report in a pipeline. The pipeline/wizard
approach was chosen because the amount of choices and required tasks would
be overhelming to users if they were all provided at once.

View descriptions are located in cz.cuni.mff.ufal.textan.gui in resources
directory, mainly names *.fxml and *.css. They also uses several custom and
modified components located in main cz.cuni.mff.ufal.textan.gui package along
with controller classes.

Controller classes concentrate on cz.cuni.mff.ufal.textan.gui package,
mainly named *Controller. There are also some custom and modified view classes
used by view descriptions.
