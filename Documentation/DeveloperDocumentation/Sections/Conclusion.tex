\comment{Ondrej}{Half page with summary: what textan is, what is described in
documentation, some of the most important extensions}

\textan{} offers semi-automatical text recognition. It extracts entities from
documents and assigns them to objects stored in the database. It utilizes existing
solution \emph{nametag} and \emph{MorphoDiTa} to recognize named entities and own
implementation of object to entity assignment, both powered by machine learning.
Its functionality is easily accessible through SOAP based webservices described by
WSDL, either through the provided client application or through a custom
implementation offering additional features or integration to a legacy system.

This documentation presents both functional and non-functional formal
requirements and architecture designed to meet these requirements. Many third
party libraries are utilized to make sure the best possible results are achieved.
Developer documentation also lists the most important decisions made during the
development effecting various parts of the project and overall overview of the
development progress. The section Possible Future Extensions contains several
major enhancements that could drastically improve either user experience with the
application or overall outcome of the system. For example the support of multiple
languages at once would make \textan{} suitable for usage in multilingual
companies or international organizations that have to process documents in many
different languages. The most important extension is however recognition of
relations between objects that could eventually lead to fully automated
processing of report without any kind of human intervention.

Although not all optional requirements have been fullfilled, \textan{}
resulted in a coherent solution meeting the goals stated in the specification
that could be further enhanced in potential continuation of the projects.
