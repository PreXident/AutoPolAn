% Section: Decisions

The section describes main decisions that was made during the development. 

\comment{Petr}{After all, I think it's better to have only one "decisions" which
will contains both decisions about used libraries and architecture.}

\comment{Adam}{This section must contain the following:
1) why pipeline? maybe also mockups here
2) why (semi)automatic processing?
3) why state on client?}
\comment{Petr}{I hope that the following outline fits your idea.}

\subsection{Fully-automatic or Semi-automatic processing}

\comment{Petr}{Describe why system need control of user}

\comment{Adam}{Check if this makes any sense}

Although automatic recognition can achieve very good results, there are many
sensitive areas where it is necessary to eliminate all errors, for example
police reports. For this reason we chose semi-automatic recognition, so users
can correct all mistakes before the system stores data into the database and
re-trains itself. Also if fully-automatic recognition is required, it is easy
to skip the human intervention entirely at cost of little overhead caused by
multiple calls of webservice operation because to pipeline decision described in
Section \ref{ssec:ReportPipeline}. Or a facade operation can be implemented to
mitigate this overhead.

\subsection{System Decomposition}

\comment{Petr}{Describe why recognition is on the server, why web server is embedded etc.}

\subsection{Control of Processing by User}
\label{ssec:ReportPipeline}

\comment{Petr}{Pipeline? ... Or something about whole UI?}

\subsection{Stateless or Stateful Communication}

\subsection{Re-learning}

\comment{Petr}{At the moment, I don't know what should be here, but I think it is important. :D
Maybe something about improving models?}

\subsection{Database}

\comment{Petr}{There must be some thing about database}

We decided to use relational database because we don't give a shit.
\comment{Venca}{That pretty much sums it up}
\comment[Venca]{Adam}{Well, we do not need a summary, on the contrary, elaborate
this as much as possible, but use apropriate language}
