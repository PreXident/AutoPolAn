% Section: Decisions

The section describes main decisions that was made during the development. 

\comment{Petr}{After all, I think it's better to have only one "decisions" which
will contains both decisions about used libraries and architecture.}

\comment{Adam}{This section must contain the following:
1) why pipeline? maybe also mockups here
2) why (semi)automatic processing?
3) why state on client?}
\comment{Petr}{I hope that the following outline fits your idea.}

\subsection{Fully-automatic or Semi-automatic processing}

\comment{Petr}{Describe why system need control of user}

\subsection{System Decomposition}

\comment{Petr}{Describe why recognition is on the server, why web server is embedded etc.}

\subsection{Control of Processing by User}

\comment{Petr}{Pipeline? ... Or something about whole UI?}

\subsection{Stateless or Stateful Communication}

\subsection{Re-learning}

\comment{Petr}{At the moment, I don't know what should be here, but I think it is important. :D
Maybe something about improving models?}

\subsection{Database}

\comment{Petr}{There must be some thing about database}

We decided to use relational database because we don't give a shit.
\comment{Venca}{That pretty much sums it up}
\comment[Venca]{Adam}{Well, we do not need a summary, on the contrary, elaborate
this as much as possible, but use apropriate language}
