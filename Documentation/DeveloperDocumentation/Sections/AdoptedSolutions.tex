\paragraph{Hibernate ORM}
%TODO Venca
Hibernate ORM (Hibernate in short) is an object-relational mapping library for
the Java language, providing a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain
model to a traditional relational database. Hibernate solves object-relational
impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct persistence-related database
accesses with high-level object handling functions.

\paragraph{Hibernate Search}
Hibernate Search is a library (or Hibernate ORM extension), which integrates
the full text library functionality from Apache Lucene in the Hibernate and
JPA model. It offers full-text search support for objects stored by Hibernate
ORM, Infinispan and other sources. Think of it as Google\texttrademark\ for
entities: search words with text, order results by relevance and find by
approximation (fuzzy search).

\paragraph{Java-ML}
%TODO Kuba/Tam
Java-ML is a machine learning library for Java. It is a collection of machine
learning and data mining algorithms.

\paragraph{Jetty}
Jetty is a pure Java-based HTTP (Web) server and Java Servlet container. It can
be embedded into other applications through Jetty API.

\paragraph{SLF4J \& Logback}
Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) provides a Java logging API by means
of a simple facade pattern. The underlying logging backend is determined
at runtime by adding the desired binding to the classpath and may be
java.util.logging, log4j or logback.

\paragraph{Spring Framework}
The Spring Framework is an open source application framework and inversion
of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features
can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building
web applications on top of the Java EE platform.
