All here.

Peter:
- server fix, started connecting the webservice with db, compile and upload name_tag binaries
- jni libraries cannot be loaded from jar, extraction is needed

Adam:
- entities selecting, problems with object webservice
- null objects cannot be send through webservices right now - Peter's xsd will hopefully solve that
  - or try sending array of array, see HWK

Jakub
- playing with nametag, features, trying to use it on messages in google drive
- nametag cannot recognize "marihuana" :-)
- own gazateer problems
- maybe add more learning data, not only messages

Tam
- next week model classifier sample
- vietnamese names not recognized :-)

HWK:
- Webservice could provide a method to get array of array of pairs representing candidate objects (with ranking) for entitites in document
  - instead of Object[] getObjects(String, Entities[]) -> CustomMap getObjects(String, Entities[])
  - custom map could be just array 
- Tam or Jakub could write a class for showing the results so far
- Adam try graph interactivity, Adam move his code to separate branch

Next meeting:
!Experiment - Sunday weekly summary report to Peter with progress!
Next Wednesday from 14:30 at 4th floor
