Jakub is missing as he broke his leg. Ondrej arrived later.

The GUI focus back on pipeline.
Tam analyzing the NER output.
Jakub model for entities, playing with new features
Venca db mapping hibernate.
Peter wsdl and xml schemas for objects transported between server and client. WSDL must be written by hand because generating is not reliable enough. Or create a nice wrapper around ugly generated sources.

NER and tagger binaries should be uploaded to google drive (preferably linux ones).

HWKS:
searching - id, alias, type, document id, relation type and source object id, relation type (give me all objects that are in relation "meet someone")

Tag multiple reports by hand, list entity types and make sure all are recognized.
- document this, how to add entity types and features, as someone may need this to adapt to other domain

Think of a special query language - not a priority

Next meeting Wednesday from 14:00
