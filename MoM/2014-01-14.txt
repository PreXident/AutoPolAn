Meeting with Ondrej and Milan Straka, Venca missing.

System overview by Milan Straka:
- entity spans - cannot overlap
- tokens marked - BILOU - Begin (only when needed - OIIIBII), Inside, Last, Out, Unit (size one)
- B and U accompanied by the type
- best sequence is chosen (dynamic programming)
- features to get the distribution of possibilities
  - two kinds - whole sentense feature, only once
    - word feature - multistaged (1 or 2, more seem not necessary); gets result from the previous words
- guesseteer - list of files of words, hard geusseteer is sure that "this is a gun"
- two repos - code (nametag.git) and data
  - retraining the recognizer, not retraining the tagger
  - will be uploaded to github
- interfaces:
  - documentation only for library users (no documentation on feature creation)
  - examples in repo
  - a lot of parameters

  - we are fine with entity spans, we do not need part of speech
  
HWK
- try example reports and send Ondrej the results

Next meeting on Wednesday 22nd at 10:00 in the lab.
