Venca finally came but after the meeting...

Exceptions in webservices possible, but Java implementation not ideal, further investigation needed.
Webservice interfaces done (only exceptions missing), needs to be pushed to git
Graph visualization still in progress. Linux problem with visualising the marked entities!

One document is one input for machine learning.
Classifier prototype ready.

Next meeting on Tuesday from 14:00, probably in the lab.
