Dears
I'm sorry that I send summary a bit later. Although it is strange, Venca sent a report and sent it as first. :)

Venca:

I'm working on the DAOs. They should be done today evening or tomorrow.

Kuba:

Nothing imprtant since Wednesday, yesterday a have smaller conflict with git, I create new branch by mistake, then i want to delete it, but i deleted the right one...but i have backup i hope.
Milan wrote me yesterday, he told me about gazetters and learning part and i asked him about binding to learning part. Milan will not do it, because it's not needed.

Adam:

so i have integrated the logo in the client :-)
and also the relation editing should work now, although there are some graphical glitches

Tam:

A few changes in the TextPro:
- Create a class DBObject (to distinguish itself with Object): two function: getDocs() and getAlias(), maybe need getRelation(). However, the function is empty
- Create a class Double Ranking, responsible for finding all object
- Create a function in Entity: getClosestObject(). (now i think it is not necessary)

Me:

I'm working on DAO with Venca, there is some crazy problem with spring, but I hope we fix it today. I also made changes in database schema, added db user for textan app etc. and I tested some plugins for gradle which creates one-jar (uber-jar,shadow jar etc.), but it seems that it will be  also  fun. I almost forgot, I worked on the server side business logic, but DAO is more important...

So, back to work, see you on Wednesday.

Petr
