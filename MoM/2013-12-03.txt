- Tam successfully made jni working
- Peter made the server pre-alfa prototype and Adam modified the client to communicate with it
- Jakub tried to write own classifier, partial success
- Venca committed a few db scripts

- machine learning - Tam and Kuba write interfaces of machine learning and NER and API so other components could use them
	- mock object to simulate the component
	- machine learner - direct communication with db or data provided by server? probably server provided
	- can JavaML handle large data? does it load all data into memory?
- try hibernate and connect to db from a application; maybe readme for dummies how to setup the db
	- or ask mff to provide some db
- decide the server side solution - maybe war inside the jar loaded to embedded jetty?
- start modelling webservices (and data objects from server to client)
- the logo is being prepared

If the NER is not ready on Friday or nothing important happens (send email on Thursday in case), the meeting will be on Tuesday on 15:40 as usual.
