Server architecture in alfa!
Tagger ready!
NER before Christmas, hopefully.
Tagger won't compile on Windows, only Unix for now.

Database clarification:
- alreadyJoined - flag indicating whether the object has beed joined with another one into new one
- Object needs to have a new field with timestamp of creation date

HWKS:
- try hibernate, see previous MoM
- spring data - layer above hibernate
- machine learning see previous MoM
- webservices more detailed
- client needs to progress finally!

The next meeting was not specified, so default value next Tuesday in use :-)
