Venca is missing!

Use msys and MinGW-w64 to compile the tagger rather than cygwin.
SWIG is not working properly on Windows (strange c++ error).

Master branch will be used to commit finished work, so everything should compile. Create own branches otherwise.
Interfaces should be named like ISomeInterface. In repository there should be unix line endings, modify your .gitattributes accordingly.

Adam - look at Model View ViewModel
Kuba - push testing project
Tam - push interface
Venca - start creating a data layer
Petr - Spring Webservices

all - try to compile the tagger on Windows

Next meeting first official one with Ondrej and Honza on Wednesday, from 14:00.
